# DSE6111 Predictive Modeling
# Heart-Attack-Prediction-
This repository shows my work in my graduate class DSE6111, where I used predictive models to find what features are commonly associated with heart attacks. As well as testing different model's accuracy on how well it can predict if a patient will have a heart attack.
